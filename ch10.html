Jacques Maritan writes:

    <blockquote>The educational task is both greater
and more mysterious and, in a sense,
humbler than many imagine. If the
aim of education is the helping and
guiding of man toward his own
human achievement, education
cannot escape the problems and
entanglements of philosophy, for it
supposes by its very nature a
philosophy of man, and from the
outset it is obliged to answer the
question: ‘What is man?’ which the
philosophical sphinx is asking.<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></blockquote>
</p>
 
<p>When philosophy comes to be seen as anathema to
education, then the question of “man,” and the
implication of any answer, fails to be explored and
understood; insofar as any such philosophy is
necessary yet unquestioned in education, the entire
endeavor fails to be grounded and proceeds blindly.
What if in our educational institutions we
denounce any historically authoritative answer to the philosophical question concerning human
existence, and then justify this attitude with the
alibi of respecting liberal freedoms? That is, what if
we reject the possibility of any answer to the
question of human nature while allowing each
individual her own idea of what human nature is?
How could this be so if, as Maritan writes, a
philosophy of man is presupposed by the very
nature of education? Perhaps a hidden and
particular philosophy of human nature pervades
the background of our educational institutions, as
well as our thinking — one that hides itself within
our relativistic denouncement of any authoritative
answer to this question. Surely some assumed
nature of man must lead one to hold that any
answer is relative: because man is such (X), there
can be no truthful answer to the question. So, what
is the ‘X’— the philosophy of man assumed in our
contemporary circumstance? We shall see,
hopefully, and contend that our educational
institutions, conceptions of education, and our
very thinking about what ‘learning’ is, are all
guided by a dualistic, Cartesian philosophy of man.
While this subject-object
(scientific) perspective may provide “information” and “tools” for
education, it seems that a vital element of
education goes missing — properly situating the
student’s self within the world around them.
Perhaps by allowing our assumptions to become
explicit, be challenged and expanded, we may
reconceive education such that perspectives beyond
the Cartesian frame of mind can enrich our
educational experiences — ones that will,
hopefully, be better able to care for the self by
properly situating it within society.</p>
     
<p>
This notion, that our current educational
activities fail to properly care for the self, might
seem to contradict our very thinking of what
education is: the advancing and improving of an
individual’s knowledge, cognitive and physical and
technical capacities, skills, etc. Yet, this seeming
contradiction must assume a particular view of the
self (and philosophy of man) in order to be seen —
the self must be somehow situated within our view
of the world for us to define education along the
terms of such improvement. If we look at our ideas
of the self, we tend to find the self as something
obviously within (or dependent on) the mind; in
turn we view the mind as within (and dependent
on) the brain: thus, we think, the self is within the
brain. We come to view improving the self in terms
of improving the functions of the brain (e.g.
processing, recognition, memory, connections,
etc.). This ‘obvious’ picture is valid: without the
brain there is no mind! But perhaps there is a less
obvious danger in reducing ‘man’, and activities
such as education and learning, strictly to this
relationship. Meaning, if we reduce the care of the
self to the sharpening of brain function, then we
may become unaware of other, vital elements to
such care.   
</p>

     
<p>
The need for such a reduction, once again,
stems from holding a dualistic, Cartesian
philosophy of human nature. This conception of
man is not necessarily one completely espoused by
René Descartes himself, as he did not reduce the
mind (res cogitans) to the brain (res extensa)— he
kept them ontologically separate; yet, the
implications and corollary notions of Descartes’
dualistic thinking remained through the historically
developed philosophy of human nature prevalent in our contemporary circumstance. Namely, that ‘I’
and the world/environment are essentially
separated— I am ‘in’ my brain, interacting with
the world outside of my brain through sensory
mediums: optical, auditory, tactile, and olfactory
senses... these are the channels between me (the ‘I’
in the brain) and the world (something completely
outside of and opposed to my mind). How physical
phenomena transduce into mental (“what its like
to...”) phenomena remains a mystery, and in light
of this mystery, I believe people are wont to entirely
reduce every aspect of ‘mind’ exclusively to the
scientific knowledge of the ‘brain’.   
</p>
 
<p>While it seems evident that scientific
knowledge of the brain is necessary for
understanding the complexity of our
consciousness, it is not sufficient. This notion goes
largely unquestioned and becomes problematic
when we strictly and exclusively oppose the mindinbrain
with the worldoutsideofbrain.
This
understanding of human consciousness ignores
other minds (an intersubjective dimension), the
environment (where the physical environment
guides the social, which in turn reshapes the
physical, and so on), and certain structures in the
world (perhaps language, history, and/or
technology); but these features and structures seem
necessary for any human consciousness (or self ) to
emerge — it is impossible to conceive of a
consciousness without these. If we admit this, then
we may dub these features and structures
‘constitutive’ of consciousness. To take this thesis to
heart is to claim that consciousness (and my self ) is
not essentially separated from structures outside my
brain; consciousness is not ‘exclusively realized’ by
the brain itself, but it is partially realized by the
world outside of the brain. This thesis is
contradictory to the Cartesian picture: that is, that
mind, self, and consciousness are entirely
dependent on and exclusively realized by neuronal
activity inside of the brain. The alien feeling of
thinking other than the Cartesian picture is a
testament to the prevalence of the picture itself —
the public consciousness conceives of mind as
being fundamentally explained by neuroscience
alone. Even ‘empirically responsible’ psychology
must aim to not contradict the Cartesian picture (and the resulting ontological reduction of ‘mind’
to ‘brain’) and always be aware of a way to tie
psychological research ‘down to’ neuroscientific
evidence. However, it is suggestive to conceive of
consciousness as essentially dependent upon
structures outside of the brain (e.g. the body,
environment, action, etc.) and/or world features
(e.g. language, history, technology, etc.). There
cannot be a freefloating
consciousness, conscious
only of itself and its subjective world.
    
</p>

<p>Of course, all of this discussion warrants
dedication and understanding, and an imagination
as to what may be wrong about the way we
conceive of the mind, the self, and consciousness.
Such research and inspiration is evident in
philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, Maurice
Merleau-Ponty,
Kitarō Nishida, and Michel
Foucault; also Hubert Dreyfus, Alva Noë, Susan
Hurley, and Mark Rowlands; there are also
movements to pursue nonCartesian,
nondualistic
cognitive science and psychology (e.g. embedded,
embodied, enactive, and extended approaches to
mind). Regardless, fully explicating or developing
any position in this domain remains beyond the
scope of this essay; because, now, we must ask
ourselves: “What could any of this have to do with
education?”</p>

<p>Resting upon the Cartesian assumption,
that the mindsinourbrains
are essentially
divorced from the worldoutsideourbrains,
separates the student from the world— they
become isolated minds dwelling only within their
own skulls, and their only intimacy or connection
with the world (including their teachers and peers)
is through a system of rules and representations
occurring off of sensory ‘input’. We conceive of the
human mind as the CPU inside of the brainhardware
which controls the inputoutput
functions of the totality of cognition; our eyes are
like cameras, ears are like microphones, all which
send ‘input data’ or information to the
visual/auditory processing modules of the brain
(the video and sound cards). This incredibly
Cartesian and machinic picture reduces the self to a
structure internal to all of these functions; it
whittles down the self to the confines of ‘cognitive
processing’ and so prohibits any substantial development outside of the objectively,
scientifically defined sense of self. (Even the noself
doctrine, as posited by the Buddha and supported
by some neuroscientists, must be a notion that
enriches our interaction with the world: in short,
we might better care for the self by learning that
there is no self! This nonCartesian
picture may
enrich our interactions as long as it is
philosophically understood.) These reductionist
perspectives, however, do bear truthfulness. Light
does enter the eye and allow vision, air vibrations
do disperse and reverberate our eardrums
for
sound— but, we cannot rest upon the claim that
such scientific knowledge ultimately gives us the
entire TRUTH, nor that nothing useful can be
thought beyond the realm of scientific knowledge
of human nature. Entertaining merely this
scientific view of man fails to ground an education
that concerns itself with the care of the self; as
Maritan writes:
    
    <blockquote>Now it is obvious that the purely
scientific idea of man can provide us
with invaluable and evergrowing
information concerning the means
and tools of education, but by itself it
can neither primarily found nor
primarily guide education, for
education needs primarily to know
what man is, what is the nature of
man and the scale of values it
essentially involves; and the purely
scientific idea of man, because it
ignores ‘beingassuch’,
does not
know such things, but only what
emerges from the human being in the
realm of sense observation and
measurement...<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></blockquote>
</p>
    
    
<p>Expanding out of our overly scientific view of
education is not simply remedied by a revitalization
of the arts and humanities—though, a sense of
this is necessary,—for the arts and humanities
remain stripped of their humanistic value as long as
the dualistic, Cartesian philosophy of man
underlies their study.</p>
    
    
<p>If this is the general philosophy of man that
we entertain in our thinking, then the thinking behind any educational activity is grounded upon a
view that essentially separates the mind/self, which
is presumably the thing being educated, from the
world/environment that one must become
educated about and ready to dwell within. This
does not imply a solution by way of the education
of entirely practical matters, though, again, a sense
of this is necessary, but by way of revealing the
student’s cultural, historical, and philosophical
‘situatedness’: which means leading a student to an
insight concerning what led to and how it came to
be that we may think whatever we think (which, in
turn, will foster greater practical knowledge). This
includes educating a student about the history of
ideas and how we arrived at this juncture: what led
to our current conceptions of the self; how our
contemporary thinking about the world still
follows Cartesian thought; and about the fact that
our objective knowledge of the mind/brain is
powerful, but, nevertheless, relies on particular
assumptions about the world. Such questioning
and education leads a student to understand their
own place in history, in society, and how it all came
to be this way. Understanding what conditions
throughout history have led to the present moment
simultaneously offers students glimpses into the
different worlds that humankind has constructed
(i.e. how different epochs encountered reality and
how those encounters organized life within
civilizations). This depth of understanding allows
the student to better imagine what the future
might, could, and should be like: the students’
imagination and creativity concerning present
issues and their solutions becomes expanded
through exposure to the evolution of different
(heterogeneous) ideas throughout history.</p>
    
<p>
The issue at hand is our model of thinking
and learning as the receiving of information from
‘outside’ of the brain through sensorychannels
into
a separated and independent self ‘inside’ of the
brain. Under this subject-object
model, every
educational endeavor is decontextualized and
reduced to bare senderreceiver
relationships; it
frames the endeavor by conceiving of knowledge
(or, the ‘known’) as a static, neutral ‘bit’ of
information ‘out there’ that is to be received by a
different entity ‘in here’ (the ‘knower’). This model reveals a functional relationship between the
student and teacher, but conceals a great deal of
what has always been cherished in education and
mentorship: a transformation of the student’s self
that is evident in their goingabout
in the world—
this is fostered by understanding connections
beyond what the Cartesian frame allows. This kind
of understanding cannot be communicated
through bits of information, but requires a
particular kind of intersubjective relationship with
a teacher (thus, online education will always fail to
foster such transformations). Only in such
relationships may learning foster a proper care for
the student. Unfortunately, however, the dualism
we are possessed with recasts not only what
‘learning’ is, but also what is to be learned. 
</p>

<p>History becomes a chronological system of
accruing facts that are causally related in time and
demand some archaeological evidence for any claim
to objectivity— or else, any historical claim void
of such evidence becomes a subjective opinion
originating within some historian’s mind. Any such
claim fails to gain significance because that
historian’s mind is inherently disconnected from
the world and requires objective data through the
sensory mediums to secure any significance.
Historically situating a student within their own
context, under this model, is to merely facilitate a
knowledge of dates, names, and events, and the rest
is up to the students’ cognitive capacities to realize
any significance. I suspect most history teachers do
not wish to conceive of history in such a way; but
when students, parents, and other faculty members
hold to such a conception, this ultimately limits a
history teacher’s ability to impart a truthful,
historical insight into why things may be the way
they are today. “We learn history so we do not
repeat it” has lost any meaning in light of the
Cartesian philosophy of man because it reinforces
the notion of history as a dead set of information
that we load into our ‘memory banks’ to improve
our behavioral output. Perhaps it is, now, more
enlightening to say: “We must learn history to
learn that we are a reiteration of it.”<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup></blockquote> We are not
historically-isolated
beings, but are cast with a
connection to something ‘eternal’ in history. We are
not freefloating
minds plopped down into history, but we are historicallyconditioned
beings created
with history: learning one’s own place in history is
learning the conditions of one’s own consciousness.
John Dewey in Democracy and Education
describes our attitude to the subject of history:
<blockquote>The segregation which kills the
vitality of history is [the] divorce [of
history] from present modes and
concerns of social life. The past just
as past is no longer our affair. If it
were wholly gone and done with,s
there would [indeed] be only one
reasonable attitude toward it. Let the
dead bury their dead. But knowledge
of the past is the key to
understanding the present.<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup></blockquote>
</p>
    
    
<p>
And, as Alfred North Whitehead writes: “The
present contains all that there is. It is holy ground;
for it is the past, and it is the future.”<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> It seems to be
a reasonable standard for education to affect a
person such that they understand how the
problematics of their present circumstance
developed out of, and in response to, past historical
paradigms. Not only who came up with what,
when, and why, but how it came to be that
discovery drives individuals into a manic frenzy
about something that is invisible to the naked eye
(e.g. an idea, a science, an artistic inspiration)—
yet, is connected to something eternal within all of
humanity (e.g. perennial questions and desires for
knowledge).
</p>
    
<p>
Programs like the STEM initiative probably
devalue any practical import of subjects like history
to their endeavor (since STEM deals with
knowledge concerning primarily the ‘outside’,
whereas much of history deals with knowledge
primarily concerning the ‘inside’), yet, we may
listen to a voice that reshaped the philosophy of
science, and introduced the notion of ‘paradigm’
into common U.S. lexicon, Thomas Kuhn. He
begins his essay, The Structure of Scientific
Revolutions, with the following words:
<blockquote>
History, if viewed as a repository for
more than anecdote or chronology,
could produce a decisive transformation in the image of
science by which we are now
possessed. That image has previously
been drawn, even by scientists
themselves, mainly from the study of
finished scientific achievements as
these are recorded in the classics and,
more recently, in the textbooks from
which each new scientific generation
learns to practice its trade. Inevitably,
however, the aim of such books is
persuasive and pedagogic; a concept
of science drawn from them is no
more likely to fit the enterprise that
produced them than an image of a
national culture drawn from a tourist
brochure or a language text. This
essay attempts to show that we have
been misled by them in fundamental
ways. Its aim is a sketch of the quite
different concept of science that can
emerge from the historical record of
the research activity itself.<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Thus, if our study of history proceeds along
the Cartesian philosophy of human nature, and
relies on a dualistic guide for what is to be learned
and how, then such an historical education will fail
to produce the “decisive transformation in the
image of science” that Kuhn calls for. Divorcing
consciousness from the world prohibits one from
understanding how history, like science, “does not
develop by the accumulation of individual
discoveries and inventions.” Learning and thinking
about history in this way results in the lack of a
student’s historical situatedness, which is a failure
to understand the present circumstance and their
own position within it. A self that fails to
understand (at least roughly) why and how the
world that the self dwells within came to be, also
fails to understand the historicity and problematics
of the world around them; if this is the case
following twelve or more years of education, then
we may honestly say that the education failed to
properly care for the student’s self.

</p>


<p>
Not only must an education that properly
cares for the self attempt to historically situate a
student, but it must also impart to a student certain nuances of understanding the world around
them.... The self must interpret the world, but
these interpretations are not merely and relatively
of the world— every interpretation must draw
from the world and is always grounded upon
something beyond our individual, subjective
opinions and assumptions. This is because the self
relates to something ‘eternal’. Though such a
notion is alien to our scientific way of thinking, we
must nonetheless admit that some form of
understanding and empathy is universal to all of
humanity; even if through suffering, there is a way
by which every person may relate to one another in
virtue of our connection to something ‘eternal’—
be it our genetic blueprint or the necessary
tragedies of every human existence, regardless of
their particular details. Awareness of such human
dimensions opens up the chasm between reason
and the emotions, and allows one to see how each
may make one another and are not, after all,
completely separate domains of the human mind.
Being open to the connection between one’s self
and the rest of humanity allows the student the
opportunity to appreciate the difference of what is
necessary, and what is contingent. Certain losses
are necessary, but the ways we deal with those
losses are contingent; the fact we must interpret
and make decisions is necessary, but the forms of
our interpretations and decisions are contingent.
Learning a responsible appreciation of all such
differences underlies the student’s ability to
properly reap the fruit that education hopes to sow.

</p>


<p>
How to structure and conceive of an
education that does properly care for the self is
also, unfortunately, beyond the scope of this essay
and warrants a worthy treatment; however,
following the analysis presented thus far, we may
perhaps begin to see how our current conceptions
of education may fail to achieve such ends.Where
we saw how our dualistic, Cartesian philosophy of
human nature fails to provide an historical
education that properly situates the student’s self,
such an analysis may be easily extended to other
subjects to reveal how these conceptions of
education and learning rob students of what
education ought to provide.
</p>

<p>
While our educational institutions may
escape the responsibilities of properly caring for the
student’s self by narrowing their efforts to the
Cartesian conception of education, the demand to
reconceive our conceptions of learning beyond the
dualistic, Cartesian philosophy of human nature
will undoubtedly provide the inspiration necessary
to reconnect, conjoin, or reintegrate the student’s
self to the world around them. This essay hopes to
have shown how this Cartesian philosophy of man
does indeed underlie our educational institutions,
regardless of their denial to support any particular
view of human nature; and, further, how this
hidden assumption fails to provide an education
that properly cares for the self. By entertaining the
possibility of such criticisms, we have already
begun to question the foundations of how we think
about learning—and, in a time of failing
educational standards and a time of intellectual
decline in the United States, such a questioning is
all one could ask for.
